            <h3>Essential Tips for Accurate Measurements</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Use a soft measuring tape</strong> - Fabric measuring tapes are more accurate than rigid rulers</li>
                <li><strong>Wear fitted clothing</strong> - Measure over undergarments or very fitted clothes</li>
                <li><strong>Stand naturally</strong> - Don't suck in your stomach or puff out your chest</li>
                <li><strong>Get help</strong> - Ask someone to help you measure, especially for back measurements</li>
                <li><strong>Measure twice</strong> - Double-check all measurements for accuracy</li>
                <li><strong>Keep the tape level</strong> - Make sure the measuring tape is parallel to the floor</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <div class="warning">
            <strong>Important:</strong> All measurements should be taken in inches. If you only have a centimeter tape, divide by 2.54 to convert to inches.

        <h2>Common Mistakes to Avoid</h2>
        <div class="warning">
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Don't measure over bulky clothing</strong> - This will give inaccurate measurements</li>
                <li><strong>Don't pull the tape too tight</strong> - The tape should be snug but not constricting</li>
                <li><strong>Don't measure when you're bloated</strong> - Take measurements when you feel normal</li>
                <li><strong>Don't round numbers</strong> - Be as precise as possible, use quarter inches</li>
                <li><strong>Don't skip measurements</strong> - Even if you think you know your size, measure everything</li>
